# Welcome to the Swahilipot Hackathon!

Welcome to all participants! We're excited to have you join this hackathon and wish you the best of luck in creating impactful solutions. Whether you're working as part of a team or individually, we believe in your potential to build something amazing.

To help you get started, here are the key open-source repositories and resources from **Tabiya** that will serve as the foundation for your work. Each one has been carefully crafted to help you build innovative solutions with ease.

## Key Resources and Repositories

### [Tabiya v1.0.0 Taxonomy - CSV Files](https://github.com/tabiya-tech/taxonomy-model-application/blob/main/backend/Import_Export_CSV_format.md)

Tabiyaâ€™s enhanced taxonomy builds on the [ESCO v1.1.1](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en) model, with significant additions, including previously overlooked work areas like micro-entrepreneurship and housework. The taxonomy has been designed to be more inclusive and semantically approachable.

You can download the latest version [here](https://platform.tabiya.tech/downloads/66fc66596df8511609d59d6e-export-66fc67206df8511609d59dbe.zip).
   
Find a description of the CSV files [here](https://github.com/tabiya-tech/taxonomy-model-application/blob/main/backend/Import_Export_CSV_format.md), and a description of our database schema [here](https://github.com/tabiya-tech/taxonomy-model-application/tree/main/backend#database-schema) to help you understand how these files are imported into the Taxonomy Model App.

Additionally, you can find [here](https://github.com/tabiya-tech/tabiya-esco-datasets-and-tools/tree/main/scripts/sqlite) a script to load the CSV data into an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database, in case you'd like to use a simple SQL database for your solution.

### [Tabiya's Livelihoods Classifier - GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tabiya-tech/tabiya-livelihoods-classifier)

This NLP pipeline is a classifier that offers an easy-to-use implementation for entity-linking job descriptions to the [ESCO v1.1.1](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en) framework. It's a valuable tool for projects involving job matching or skill classification.

To run the pipeline, you will need a Hugging Face access token, which we will provide.

### [Compass by Tabiya - GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tabiya-tech/compass/)

Compass by Tabiya is an AI chatbot designed to assist job seekers in exploring and discovering their skills.

Compass is a sophisticated chatbot, and you can read more about it [here](https://docs.tabiya.org/compass/).

To run the backend and frontend locally, you will need:
   1. Service account credentials for GCP
   2. Access to the taxonomy database
   3. Invite and registration codes to import into your local MongoDB instance
   
We will provide all the necessary credentials and codes.

### **[Taxonomy Model App - GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tabiya-tech/taxonomy-model-application)**

This cloud-native application by Tabiya enables users to explore and modify taxonomy models. While you won't be able to run it locally, you can review the code to understand how the UI, backend, API, and database work. You can also explore all the UI components of the application in [Storybook](https://github.com/tabiya-tech/taxonomy-model-application/tree/main/frontend#storybook).

Good luck to everyone! We can't wait to see the creative and impactful solutions you build.
